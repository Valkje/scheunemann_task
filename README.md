# Background

This is the experiment code for a simple driving task that can be performed by human participants. The code base is taken from [Dario Salvucci's Java driving model](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~salvucci/cog/act-r/projects.php) and modified to be performed by participants. This experiment was conducted to validate model behavior predicted by our recently developed model which combines Dario Salvucci's driving model with an n-back model. This is used to perform the task described in Scheunemann et al. (2019). To successfully run the experiment, you'll need the jinput package.
